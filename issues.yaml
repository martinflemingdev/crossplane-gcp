CRD:
  apiVersion: bigquery.gcp.upbound.io/v1beta1
  kind: Dataset

Problem:
  It appears the Dataset name is derived from the K8s "metadata.name" field and not a field in the CRD's spec.forProvider
  This could work but both fields have different constraints and therefore clash.

Google contraint error when using dash:
# apply failed: Error creating Dataset: googleapi: Error 400: Invalid dataset ID "example-dataset". 
# Dataset IDs must be alphanumeric (plus underscores) and must be at most 1024 characters long.
Google constraint error when using period:
# observe failed: cannot run refresh: refresh failed: Invalid resource name: 
# A name must start with a letter or underscore and may contain only letters, digits, underscores, and dashes.
K8s constraint error when using underscore:
# The Dataset "example_dataset" is invalid: metadata.name: Invalid value: "example_dataset": a lowercase RFC 1123 subdomain 
# must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters, '-' or '.', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character 
# (e.g. 'example.com', regex used for validation is '[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*')

Possible Solution:
  Add a "spec.forProvider.name" field so that the Dataset name is not derived from "metadata.name"
  There is a "spec.forProvider.friendlyName" field currently, but filling it out does not solve the issue.

CRD:
  apiVersion: bigquery.gcp.upbound.io/v1beta1
  kind: Table

Problem: 
  spec.forProvider.schema expects a stringified version of an array of objects instead of actual datatypes

Example:
  schema: |
    [
      {
        "name": "permalink",
        "type": "STRING",
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "description": "The Permalink"
      },
      {
        "name": "state",
        "type": "STRING",
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "description": "State where the head office is located"
      }
    ]

Possible Solution:
  Amend CRD to have schema type be an array of objects and not string

CRD:
  apiVersion: datacatalog.gcp.upbound.io/v1beta1
  kind: Entry

Problem: 
  spec.forProvider.schema expects a json string instead of actual datatypes

Example:
  schema: |
    {
      "columns": [
        {
          "column": "id",
          "type": "INT64",
          "description": "Unique identifier",
          "mode": "REQUIRED"
        },
        {
          "column": "name",
          "type": "STRING",
          "description": "Name of the individual",
          "mode": "NULLABLE"
        },
        {
          "column": "email",
          "type": "STRING",
          "description": "Email address",
          "mode": "NULLABLE"
        }
      ]
    }

Possible Solution:
  Amend CRD to have schema type be an object and not a string

CRD:
  apiVersion: storage.gcp.upbound.io/v1beta1
  kind: BucketObject

Problem:
  BucketObject does not support source field. 
  https://github.com/upbound/provider-gcp/issues/9

  Source field would allow uploading files via path, without it we only have "content" field.

Example:

  spec:
    forProvider:
      bucket: example-bucket
      content: "Content of text file goes here"
      contentType: text/plain
      name: input.txt

Possible Solution:
  Support source field like terraform does.
