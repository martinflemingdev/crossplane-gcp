                          The maximum number of replicas this DeployedModel may be deployed on when the traffic against it increases.

If traffic against the DeployedModel increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value is not provided, a no upper bound for scaling under heavy traffic will be assume, though Vertex AI may be unable to scale beyond certain replica number.

                          If traffic against it increases, it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas up to maxReplicaCount, and as traffic decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed. If the requested value is too large, the deployment will error.

                      Creating deployment_groups with reserved_ip_ranges is a recommended practice when the peered network has multiple peering ranges. This creates your deployments from predictable IP spaces for easier traffic administration. Also, one deployment_group (except 'default') can only be used with the same reserved_ip_ranges which means if the deployment_group has been used with reserved_ip_ranges: [a, b, c], using it with [a, b] or [d, e] is disallowed. See the official documentation here.
                      Note: we only support up to 5 deployment groups (not including 'default').

                      Creating deployment_groups with reserved_ip_ranges is a recommended practice when the peered network has multiple peering ranges. This creates your deployments from predictable IP spaces for easier traffic administration. Also, one deployment_group (except 'default') can only be used with the same reserved_ip_ranges which means if the deployment_group has been used with reserved_ip_ranges: [a, b, c], using it with [a, b] or [d, e] is disallowed. See the official documentation here.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.

This creates your deployments from predictable IP spaces for easier traffic administration. Also, one deployment_group (except 'default') can only be used with the same reserved_ip_ranges which means if the deployment_group has been used with reserved_ip_ranges: [a, b, c], using it with [a, b] or [d, e] is disallowed.
